                <p style="color:lightslategrey;">The iPhone (retroactively referred to as the iPhone 2G, iPhone 1, or original iPhone) is the first iPhone model and the first smartphone designed and marketed by Apple Inc. After years of rumors and speculation, it was officially announced on January 9, 2007, and was released in the United States on June 29, 2007.Development of the iPhone as a product began in 2005 and continued in complete secrecy until its unveiling. The device broke with prevailing mobile phone designs by eliminating most physical hardware buttons and eschewing a stylus for its finger-friendly touch interface, featuring instead only a few physical buttons and a touch screen. It featured quad-band GSM cellular connectivity with GPRS and EDGE support for data transfer, and it used continuous internet access and onboard processing to support features unrelated to voice communication. </p>

                The iPhone's iOS operating system (OS) was initially used for the iPad but in September 2019, its OS was switched to a fork of iOS called iPadOS that has better support for the device's hardware and its user interface is customized for the tablets' larger screens. The iPad's App Store is subject to application and content approval. Many older devices are susceptible to jailbreaking, which circumvents these restrictions. The first generation of iPad was announced on January 27, 2010, and pre-ordering began on March 12. </p>

                    The original iPad Pro was introduced in September 2015, and ran iOS 9. It had an A9X chip, and came in two sizes: 9.7-inch and 12.9 inch. The second-generation iPad Pro, unveiled in June 2017, had an upgraded A10X Fusion chip and swapped the 9.7-inch screen for a larger 10.5-inch display. The third-generation iPad Pro, announced in October 2018, eliminated the home button, and featured Face ID; it came in 11-inch and 12.9-inch models, the same screen sizes used by every subsequent model to date. A Wi-Fi-capable version was released in the United States on April 3 and a 3G-capable version was released on April 30.</p>

                <p style="color: white;">The macbook is a brand of Mac notebook computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc. that use Apple's macOS operating system since 2006. It replaced the PowerBook and iBook brands during the Mac transition to Intel processors, announced in 2005. The current lineup consists of the macbook Air (2008–present) and the macbook Pro (2006–present). Two different lines simply named "macbook" existed from 2006 to 2012 and 2015 to 2019. The macbook brand was the "world's top-selling line of premium laptops" as of 2015. The original macbook Pro used the design of the PowerBook G4, but replaced the PowerPC G4 chips with Intel Core processors, added a webcam, and introduced the MagSafe power connector. The 15-inch model was introduced in January 2006; the 17-inch model in April. Later revisions added Intel Core 2 Duo processors and LED-backlit displays.</p>

                <p style="color: white;">The macbook family was initially housed in designs similar to the iBook and PowerBook lines which preceded them, now making use of a unibody aluminum construction first introduced with the macbook Air. This new construction also has a black plastic keyboard that was first used on the macbook Air, which itself was inspired by the sunken keyboard of the original polycarbonate macbooks. The now standardized keyboard brings congruity to the macbook line, with black keys on a metallic aluminum body. The macbook Pro is a line of Mac laptops made by Apple Inc. Introduced in January 2006, it is the higher-end lineup in the macbook family, sitting above the consumer-focused macbook Air. It is currently sold with 14-inch and 16-inch screens, all using Apple silicon M-series chips.</p>
